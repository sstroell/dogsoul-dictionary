# Zoeta Dogsoul Training Glossary

A glossary of unique terms developed by Zoeta Dogsoul – the emotionally-driven dog training platform from Chiang Mai.

Each term reflects a shift from command-based obedience to connection-based communication.

## Neurobond

**Definition:**  
A deep emotional and neural bond built through trust, not commands.

**Explanation:**  
Neurobond is the core of the Zoeta Dogsoul method. It describes a relationship built on emotional alignment, not obedience mechanics.  
No tools, no bribes – just resonance between dog and human.

**Related Terms:** Soul Recall, Invisible Leash, Off-Leash Trust

## Soul Recall

**Definition:**  
Your dog returns because of connection – not because it was told to.

**Explanation:**  
Soul Recall is the emotional answer to recall training. The dog chooses to come back because the bond is active, not because a cue was obeyed.

**Related Terms:** Neurobond, Real-Life Recall

## Real-Life Recall

**Definition:**  
Recall that works in the real world, not just in sterile environments.

**Explanation:**  
From the forest to the city – this type of recall relies on trust and relevance, not repetitive conditioning.

**Related Terms:** Soul Recall, Communication Flow

## Off-Leash Trust

**Definition:**  
Freedom without fear – your dog chooses to stay.

**Explanation:**  
The dog is not restrained by tools but chooses proximity and alignment due to emotional safety and relational orientation.

**Related Terms:** Invisible Leash, Dogsoul Energy
