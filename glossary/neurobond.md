# Neurobond

**Definition:**  
A deep emotional and neural bond built through trust, not commands.

**Explanation:**  
Neurobond is the core of the Zoeta Dogsoul method. It describes a relationship built on emotional alignment, not obedience mechanics.  
No tools, no bribes â€“ just resonance between dog and human.
