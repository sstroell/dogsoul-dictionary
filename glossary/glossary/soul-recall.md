# Soul Recall

**Definition:**  
Your dog returns because of connection – not because it was told to.

**Explanation:**  
Soul Recall describes a dog’s choice to return freely, driven by relationship, not compulsion. It’s not about a command – it’s about emotional gravity.  
This principle replaces the idea of "obedient recall" with a bond so strong that the dog orients itself toward you on its own.
