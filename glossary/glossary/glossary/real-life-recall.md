# Real-Life Recall

**Definition:**  
Recall that works in the real world, not just in sterile environments.

**Explanation:**  
Real-Life Recall refers to a dog’s ability to return in distracting, dynamic environments — not just in controlled training spaces.  
It’s trained through relationship, repetition in real-world situations, and emotional clarity, not luring or bribing.
